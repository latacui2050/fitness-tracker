# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Group Project 2: Fitness-Tracker

## Project 2 Full Stack Application - Challenge Guideline

Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to know what you can do, but they also want to know how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

With your group, you’ll again conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

For this project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will allow you to revisit your front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify your understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. Your skills have continued to improve since the first two projects, so naturally your approach will be different considering the experience you’ve gained with each new application you’ve built.

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN-stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to observe. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Render (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you should add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 20.

## User Story

```
I WANT TO BE FIT AND HEALTHY.
As someone working towards my fitness goals, I would like to build a tool with which I can easily track my workout progress, 
mark the milestones, and meet more fitness pals.
```

## Purpose

This app is designed to allow users to log and track specific workout sessions, including details such as exercise type, duration, intensity, and repetitions.


## Important Statement About App Completeness

Due to time constraints, the app is not able to be finished in entirety; only part of the features are realized. The following description outlines the mock-up; the developers are in the process of debugging and the complete product will be made alive soon.

## App Features(Mock-up)

* Create new user account
  * Log in next time
*Activity Tracking
  * Monitor daily activities such as steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned.
  * Allow users to log and track specific workout sessions, including details such as exercise type, duration, intensity, and repetitions.
  * Enable users to set fitness goals, whether they are related to weight loss, muscle gain, running distance, or other health-related objectives.
  * Include features for logging and monitoring dietary intake, allowing users to track their calorie consumption, macronutrient balance, and hydration levels.
